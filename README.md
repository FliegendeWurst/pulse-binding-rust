Overview
========

This repository contains *sys* and *binding* libraries (crates) for connecting to PulseAudio (PA)
from the Rust programming language.

These are provided for each of the three system libraries:
 * `libpulse_binding` for `libpulse`,
 * `libpulse_simple_binding` for `libpulse-simple`, and
 * `libpulse_glib_binding` for `libpulse-mainloop-glib`.

The *sys* crates provide basic interfaces to the raw C APIs, while the *bindings* add Rust-oriented
higher-level abstractions on top of these. (It is the bindings that you should prefer to make direct
use of in Rust applications).

See the respective library sub-directories for details.

PulseAudio Version Compatibility
================================

Please see the separate `COMPATIBILITY.md` file for discussion of PA version compatibility.

Author
======

These bindings were not produced by the PulseAudio project, they were produced by an independent
developer - Lyndon Brown.

Copyright & Licensing
=====================

All parts of these binding libraries are fully open-source and free to use.

## Primary Licensing - LGPL

All files in this source code repository, except as noted below, are licensed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1+. (See file `LICENSE-LGPL` for details).

This matches the current licensing of PulseAudio itself.

## Alternate Licensing

A popular alternative to GPL/LGPL, especially I have noticed in the world of Rust crates, is a dual
MIT and Apache-2.0 licensing model. I *would* license this project under such a model, however
unfortunately I believe that there is a strong possibility that it would be considered a ‘derivative
work’ of PulseAudio, and as such is constrained to LGPL by the licensing of PulseAudio itself.

Thus you may freely consider this project available under said dual MIT and Apache-2.0 licensing
only under one of the following conditions:
 - Either, should I be wrong about the ‘derivative work’ principle, i.e. that there is no actual
   restriction imposed by the PulseAudio LGPL license on my bindings being licensed under this
   alternate model. (In which case please inform me thusly).
 - Or, you are granted license to use PulseAudio itself under such licensing, removing the barrier
   to use of these bindings under same.
 - Or, should the PulseAudio project grant explicit permission for this project to be licensed under
   such a model.
 - Or, should the PulseAudio project grant you explicit permission to use these bindings under such
   license, i.e. an exception to their LGPL ‘derivative work’ restriction.

## Licensing/Copyright Specifics

The files within the ‘includes’ directory, have been copied directly from the PulseAudio source.
These files are kept for development purposes only (to be compared through diff checking against
future versions to find changes that may need propagating into the bindings). To be clear, they are
not used in any compilation processes. They are licensed under LGPL by the PulseAudio project.

The *binding* and *sys* libraries provided in this source code repository have been built upon the
public API of PulseAudio, as described by the PulseAudio ‘include’ files, with documentation in
particular largely copied from those files.

The logo image files are a combined derivative of the Rust programming language icon and the
PulseAudio icon, taking core elements from each. I apply no specific image-oriented license upon
them (I am not familiar with such licenses). As a substitute, subject to any constraints of
licensing of those original images, I freely permit use on a common-sense fair-use basis. For
instance, you may freely make use of them in articles discussing this project (should anyone ever
care to do so). Feel free to make your own such derived logos, I make no claim upon it being an
original idea.
